        <p>This app was inspired by my boyfriend and his passion for films. On every
          Sunday, he meets up with his friends online and they all watch a movie. Every 
          person has a chance to pick a movie for the group and a common problem they face
          is keeping track of the movies they've seen. Flix-Fix is an app to answer to this 
          problem!
